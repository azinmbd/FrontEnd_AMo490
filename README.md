## 1. Introduction
The proposed project seeks to develop an AI-powered recipe sharing website that enables users to share their culinary creations and receive personalized recipe recommendations based on the ingredients in their fridge. This innovative platform leverages the power of artificial intelligence to enhance the user experience and foster a dynamic community of food enthusiasts.

## 2. Proposed Research Project
The primary goal of our organization is to develop an AI-powered website with a user-friendly interface that enables users to easily search, filter, or receive AI-based recommendations based on the ingredients available in their refrigerators. This platform aims to provide users with effortless access to share their own recipes, as well as follow step-by-step instructions shared by users worldwide who utilize the platform. Our website is a cutting-edge solution that leverages AI technology to deliver a seamless and intuitive experience for its users.

### 2.1. Objectives and Methodologies
- Creating an eye-catching design that is easy to use.
- Following UX design principles to make a user-friendly platform.
- Incorporating a modern design for the landing page to showcase our most important features.
- Utilizing AI recommendations based on the ingredients users request.
- Identifying areas that other similar platforms do not cover and implementing those features.
- Focusing on improving features that other similar platforms lack to attract more users.
- Implementing a fast-loading frontend to achieve higher rankings in GTmetrix and compete with others.
- Utilizing SEO in both development and content on our platform to rank higher in search engines.
- Using high-quality images, light vectors, and animations.
- Developing the website with modern libraries and popular languages to ensure compatibility with most browsers and devices.

### 2.2. Data Collection, Sample Size, and Analysis Technologies
Our platform collects user-based data, including the recipes they add, and interaction data, such as clicks and searches, to improve the design. We strive for diversity by including various recipes from different countries and cultures. Our sample size includes all users across the world who are interested in cooking or looking to gain experience in it.
To analyze this data, we gather user feedback and run UX tests to ensure our platform is user friendly. In further steps, we will also be using user engagement metrics.

### 2.3. Technologies Used
- **OS:** Cross platform
- **Backend language/Framework:** JavaScript, NodeJS runtime, MongoDB, ExpressJS
- **Frontend language/Framework:** Redux, Redux Toolkit, Redux thunk, Redux persist, ReactJs, React Router, Axios, Sass, Material UI, HTML
- **Database:** MongoDB

### 2.4. Expected Results
Our goal is to create a web-based platform for sharing recipes that is user friendly and fully functional. The platform will also provide AI based recommendations to users, offering better solutions and functionality compared to similar platforms currently available. Our research has shown that there are several recipe apps in the market, such as AllRecipes, Yummly, and Tasty. These apps offer a range of features, including a vast selection of recipes with user reviews, instructions, and photos. Yummly offers personalized recommendations to cater to users' tastes and dietary needs and lets users save and categorize their favorite recipes. Our aim is to develop a more pleasant and unified solution that amalgamates the best features of existing applications mixed with AI to provide a better experience for users in finding what they are looking for.
